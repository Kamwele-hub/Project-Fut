This is my first single page Web app for Moringa School.
Single-page application on vanilla javascript with History API routing, OpenWeatherMap API to show the weather in different parts of the world in real time.
It also provides data on sunrise and sunset.
It gives wind speeds and atmospheric pressure..
Event listeners will be added with time..
